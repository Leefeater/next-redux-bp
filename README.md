# SandBox NextJS app with redux boilerplate

This is a quick way to have a next app with a redux store connected.  This is only for sandbox applications.
Its recommended to set up redux using the redux-wrapper component in next.js  But this works just fine for 
sandbox applications.  State will be maintained across pages.

This uses redux-toolkit for the store set up.


## Installation
